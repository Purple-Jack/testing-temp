Keep in mind that Libre Office is slightly slower than MS and it also lacks some functionality compared to MS regardless it is packed with functionality and it almost on par with MS for most if not all users. People who have used MS for a long time might find it difficult to adapt to Libre Office.

# Backing up data

**Why you must have a backup of your data?**

We never know what will happen to our devices so it is better to be safe than sorry and create a backup of all important files. You may have noticed that sometimes when you try to do something in your device you are prompted to create a backup that is because during the process there is a possibility that you may lose your files. There is the threat of malware corrupting files or even your hard disk physically getting damaged. So rather than ending up in a situation where you won't be able to recover your device it is much better to have a backup. [6 Ways to Back up a Computer - wikiHow](https://www.wikihow.com/Back-up-a-Computer "https://www.wikihow.com/Back-up-a-Computer") [What’s the Best Way to Back Up My Computer?](https://www.howtogeek.com/242428/whats-the-best-way-to-back-up-my-computer/ "https://www.howtogeek.com/242428/whats-the-best-way-to-back-up-my-computer/") [What is Cloud Storage? | AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-storage/ "https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-storage/") as of now for a free account [https://mega.io/](https://mega.io/ "https://mega.io/") (freemium and code is open to some extent) provides 20GB of cloud storage. One drive 5gb and G Drive 15 GB.

# browser extensions

since these extensions can read data its better to use them on a separate browser rather than main one 
instructions on how to set up extension are mentioned & they are quite simple

[https://ublockorigin.com/](https://ublockorigin.com/ "https://ublockorigin.com/") must use **Adblock** on browsers `foss` Ublock origin is recommended by many Privacy advocates.

Also, avoid extensions unless they are trustworthy like ublock origin. Just look up how extensions see your data and are potentially harmful.

These extensions do a cool job of removing paywalls and also not messing up with the original layout of the website.

# Bypass paywalls

to **bypass paywalls** these can be used to read news etc that are hidden behind

1. Use [https://12ft.io/](https://12ft.io/ "https://12ft.io/")
  
2. Search the name of the article on the web and some other website probably might have uploaded it.
  
3. Reader mode. Most browsers have the option to remove adds and bypass paywalls. Look up how to use reader mode in your browser. 
  if you don't want to manually bypass paywall every time:
  
4. Or use browser extensions that bypass paywalls [tech-stuff/browser extensions.md at main · Purple-Jack/tech-stuff · GitHub](https://github.com/Purple-Jack/tech-stuff/blob/main/browser%20extensions.md#browser-extensions)
  

# CLI Command line interface tips

[Under Construction..]

**A list of windows cmd commands:** [An A-Z Index of Windows CMD commands - SS64.com](https://ss64.com/nt/ "https://ss64.com/nt/")

[Command Prompt: What It Is and How to Use It](https://www.lifewire.com/command-prompt-2625840)

[How to use the PowerShell documentation - PowerShell | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/how-to-use-docs?view=powershell-7.2)

There are many useful Command Line Interface Apps and there are situations you may need to use a command and and in some cases the command line is just faster than Graphical User Interface (GUIs).

The CL can basically do everything GUIs can. Ever wonder why you shouldn't run random .exe files? its because they do stuff and some do it in the command line (PowerShell or command prompt in windows)

That is why you shouldn't run random apps and scripts with admin privileges. Only if you trust the app and know what you are doing run C prompt or PowerShell with admin privileges.

You can use package managers like chocolatey winget etc in windows to easily install apps in my experience it is just better this way sometimes and even faster but for some instances GUIs are better because they make things easier.

The obvious problem is that you will have to know certain commands and know how to do stuff. You can easily find them online it doesn't take more than 10 minutes to learn how to do things in the command line like copy pasting files and moving inside directories. You will need to know these stuff if you want to run command line apps like OCRmypdf, YT-DLP, ffmpeg etc. However there are also GUI versions of some CLI apps so yay!

Linux users will probably understand a lot more things useful about the command line and Linux systems use CL more often than windows.

Read official documentation they are your friend! they will guide you through the entire thing.

for eg: [cd | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cd)

why you must encrypt your disk?

you may have a password in your PC to protect your files however one can easily boot into a live USB and easily access your files that's why you must encrypt your disk among other reasons.
